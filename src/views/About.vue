      <h2>The Tzu Chi Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        The Tzu Chi Foundation is a global relief organization whose main
        missions are charity, education, medicine, and humanistic culture. The
        organization was founded in Taiwan by Dharma Master Cheng in 1966, and
        it began as a group of 30 housewives who saved money everyday, which
        would then be donated to those in need. This incentivized others to
        follow their acts of compassion. The organization expanded throughout
        the years and became a major organization to provide relief services.
        The Tzu Chi Foundation today consists of over 10 million members
        worldwide in over 50 countries. In 2020, Tzu Chi has provided aid to 125
        countries, donated over 2 million medical masks, provided food to over
        70 thousand households
