        <h3>1. Do I have to pay dues to become a member?</h3>
        <p>
          No! You do not have to pay a single penny to be part of our
          organization
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>2. Do I have to be Buddhist or Asian?</h3>
        <p>
          No! The Tzu Chi Foundation is an international organization that has
          volunteers from many different backgrounds, races, religions, etc.

        <h3>3. Do I have to be vegan / vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>
          We promote environmental protection by having a vegan / vegetarian
          diet. This diet eliminates environmental pollution and shows
          compassion towards animals; however, you do <strong>NOT</strong> have
          to be vegetarian / vegan to be part of our organization
        </p>

        <h3>4. What's the difference between "Tzu Chi" and "Tzu Ching"?</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Tzu Chi</em> is our main international-relief organization. In
          Chinese, it means "Compassionate Relief".
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tzu Ching</em> is the collegiate-level of Tzu Chi. In Chinese, it
          means "Compassionate Youth." We are the CSULB collegiate branch of Tzu
          Chi, hence we are called CSULB Tzu Ching. We are also sometimes called
          the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association of CSULB. Hopefully those terms
          aren't confusing!!

        <h3>5. What is the uniform that you wear? How can I get one?</h3>
        <p>
          Tzu Chi members wear a blue Tzu Chi shirt, white pants, and white
          socks for their uniform. It signifies blue skies and white clouds. By
          wearing our uniforms, we are building a presence for those who are
          receiving our help
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain a uniform, you must reach 20 hours of volunteering across
          <u>4 unique events</u>. This includes food distributions, medical
          outreaches, etc. General meetings, book club gatherings, and Dharma
          studies also count towards your hours. Social events
          <strong>DO NOT</strong> count. Hours carry over between semesters /
          years
