    <h3>The Tzu Chi Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      The Tzu Chi Foundation (<em>tzu</em> - "compassionate", <em>chi</em> -
      "relief") is a global relief organization whose main missions are charity,
      education, medicine, and humanistic culture. The organization was founded
      in Taiwan by Dharma Master Cheng in 1966, and it began as a group of 30
      housewives who saved money everyday, which would then be donated to those
      in need. This incentivized others to follow their acts of compassion. The
      organization expanded throughout the years and became a major organization
      to provide relief services. The Tzu Chi Foundation today consists of over
      10 million members worldwide in over 50 countries. In 2020, Tzu Chi has
      provided aid to 125 countries, donated over 2 million medical masks,
      provided food to over 70 thousand households, and benefitted 17,335
      students from their tutoring program
