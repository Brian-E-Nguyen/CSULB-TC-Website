      Welcome to CSULB Tzu Ching (and our newly redesigned website!)
    </h2>
    <p>
      CSULB Tzu Ching (also known as the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association of
      CSULB) are a volunteering organization of diverse students that focuses on
      medicine, education, charity, and humanistic culture. We serve as the
      CSULB collegiate chapter for our mother organization: the Tzu Chi
      Foundation.

      As of September 2023, this website has been redesigned with a strong focus
      on simplicity and minimalism while still delivering essential information
      to our users.
