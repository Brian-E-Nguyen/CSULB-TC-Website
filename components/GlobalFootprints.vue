          Charity
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tzu Chi provides food, clothing, shelter, direct financial assistance,
          and more. Transforming feelings of helplessness and despair into hope
          and empowerment, and bringing out the good in people through the
          happiness they discover when helping others is also our goal.

          Medicine
        </h3>
        <p>
          Providing medical care to those who lack the means to pay was Tzu
          Chi’s priority from the start. Today, we have a comprehensive network
          of hospitals, mobile units, doctors, medical professionals and
          volunteers offering free healthcare. We value the wellbeings of
          patients, families, and medical teams equally.

          Education
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tzu Chi has schools, colleges, and universities worldwide. The
          objective is to deliver superior education, and nurture virtue,
          kindness, compassion, and joy in selfless giving. With deep faith in
          human nature, we advance universal respect towards all people,
          regardless of race, culture, language or religion.

          Humanistic Culture
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tzu Chi is dedicated to fostering humanistic culture through civil
          responsibility and personal character. Founded on Buddhist philosophy,
          we advocate the view that as individuals, we should aspire to be
          moral, self-aware, and willing to act for the benefit of others. We
          pacify negative emotions, develop love and compassion, and attain
          wisdom.

          International Relief
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are accredited by the United Nations and mobilize to provide
          international disaster relief in a big way. Our volunteers arrive with
          immediate emergency necessities like food, clothing, shelter, and
          medical supplies. We also offer direct financial aid to those in need.
          And, we’re on the ground for the long haul, rebuilding, setting up
          schools and water supply, offering free clinics, and more.

          Bone Marrow Donor Registry
        </h3>
        <p>
          What better way is there to ease human suffering, than saving a life?
          Donating bone marrow can do that, with no harm to you. Tzu Chi
          facilitates the process of finding a genetic match for those who
          require marrow, by managing a Bone Marrow Donor Registry. We also have
          an umbilical cord blood repository and support ongoing stem cell
          research and gene therapy.

          Environmental Protection
        </h3>
        <p>
          We believe that we can protect the environment through the choices we
          make and our behavior as individuals. We actively promote waste
          reduction and recycling. We advocate a healthy diet consisting of less
          meat and more fruits and vegetables. Living a simpler lifestyle and
          reducing our carbon footprint is crucial towards living in harmony
          with Mother Earth.

          Volunteers
        </h3>
        <p>
          Putting compassion into action is at the heart of Tzu Chi’s mission.
          We have a global community of millions of volunteers selflessly
          sharing their time, applying their energy, and offering their
          individual capacity for the benefit of others. With their sincerity
          and love, volunteers make all our charity, medical, educational,
          international relief, and environmental protection programs possible.
